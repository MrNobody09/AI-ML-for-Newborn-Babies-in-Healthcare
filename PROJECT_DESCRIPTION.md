## ‚ú®Welcome to AI-ML-for-Newborn-Babies-in-Healthcare

## üë©‚ÄçüíªGet ready for your first Contribution.

I will be sharing a video dataset link and password to it, inside that you'll be having video datasets of the babies admitted in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). 
You have to download the video datasets to your desktop and extract image frames from it. For image extraction, the tech stack that you need to use is Python.

Before you get into this, refer this link and learn how to extract images from a pre-captured video. Any doubts, don't hesitate to ask.

- Go to the above link/copy paste the link in your Chrome browser, and click on iCOPEvid folder inside and download all the video datasets to your desktops.
Once done with that, create a directory image datasets and add 4 new folders in your project directory in your desktop and name the folders as No Pain, Mild, Moderate and 
Severe respectively.

- Next, you can start extracting the image datasets from those videos using Python code, extract only 50 images from 1 video data and later you have to convert every image 
to gray scale(black and white) image. That means from 1 video you'll be getting 100 images totally, 50 colored images and 50 gray scale images.

- Once you have finished extracting 100 images, seeing the facial expressions of the babies, classify them onto the 4 folders that you have created. If baby's expression 
is normal, then you can put those images inside No pain folder, if baby is having some painful expressions, put them under Mild or Moderate folders and if the expression 
seems to look like severe and crying, then put the images into the Severe folder. This is how you train your model. Do it in the same way, for all the videos that you 
have downloaded from the link given.


## üí°Here are some important things for the project that you all have to keep in mind during this open-source contribution program.

1. This is a research based learning + contributing project, so you get more to learn on your own and implement it.
2. Before starting to contribute, go through some of the theoretical aspects of the project:
    A. Why newborns are admitted to NICU?
    B. What is Pain-Scale Assessment?
    C. Basics of OpenCV and how facial expressions detection can be done using OpenCV in Python.
    D. Why is the risk of survival of Preterm(Premature) Newborn babies higher compared to normally delivered newborn babies?
You can find the details of all these information in Google, if anyone finding it difficult to find then you can reach out to us, we'll provide you with the links to 
refer.
3. Please maintain a friendly atmosphere, and you can always reach out to us at any time for even the silliest of doubt that you 
have. Feel free to ask any doubts that you want to get it cleared.

That's it, enjoy while learning new things and technologies. Never think it's difficult or impossible for you to do something. Everything is possible!! Cheers. üôå


Happy Learning !! ü§ó
