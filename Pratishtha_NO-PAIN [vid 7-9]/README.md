**GOAL**

To extract colored and grayscale images from vid[7-9] and classify them into 3 folders(no-mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain)


**PURPOSE**

My purpose was not only to achieve goal, but also to learn along, and so I did my research, implemented it in my code and extracted the images and classified them.


**DATASET**

[Dataset-Video Files](https://livemissouristate-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/nyc10040_missouristate_edu/Ev2GCLuXRK1DsgbeiRGRywkBBzLLqRH-OKaMi3rFHuM3iA?e=Zm3XcU)


**DESCRIPTION**

I read about How to extract images from multiple sources and then implemented it in my code.


**WHAT I HAD DONE**

First, you can refer my code files in Model folder to understand the code I have used(which is commented to make it easy to understand), then to see the Outcome of my approach, refer to Image Datasets folder and you can see the Colored and Grayscale images in different respective folders.


**WORKFLOW OF YOUR PROJECT FILES**

Refer to compilation steps below, and go through the code. The final Image Datasets folder has images classified into folders based on Facial Expressions.


**STATE YOUR PROCEDURE AND UNDERSTANDING FROM YOUR WORK**

I did discuss the problem and how to approach the issue with Project Admin, and with their guidance, I read from sources and implemented learnt knowledge into my code to make it better, simpler and to save time too.


**DETAILED EXPLANATION OF SCRIPT, IF APPLICABLE**

My code files are added with comments to undrstand my approach.


**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

- cv2
- os
- Glob

**COMPILATION STEPS**

Import Libraries -> Read the video files from the folder they are saved in -> Extract image frames for each video -> Save them in a folder -> Then, convert these frames to grayscale -> Save them in a folder.


**RESEARCH**

I was completely new to OpenCV, so this was an exposure opportunity, where I got to learn about how to extract images, I have added references below.


**SCREENSHOTS**

The images in the Image Dataset folder are the Output of my code.


**CONCLUSION**

The conclusion is after researching and implementing into my Code and then, classifying Images, the Dataset will be used to come up with a model.
