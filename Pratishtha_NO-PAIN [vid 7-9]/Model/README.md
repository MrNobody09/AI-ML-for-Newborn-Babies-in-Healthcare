## CODE FILES

The above code files are the codes I have used form extracting colored anfd Grayscale images.
I have added comments in my code to make it easy for the reader to understand my approach.

My approaches are based on- not only to extract images but to do that at once.
It means instead of extracting images from videos separately, my code will do that for all videos in a specific folder at once.
Similary, when I need to convert those image frames to grayscale, my code will convert all images in a specific folder to grayscale images at once.
