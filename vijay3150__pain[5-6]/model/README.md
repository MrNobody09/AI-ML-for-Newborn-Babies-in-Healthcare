The above file contains the code to extract images from 2 videos i.e 5 and 6 from pain folder.

Extracted 50 frames each from both the videos at once using python opencv and os modules.
Converted the image into grayscale using cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY. Used os.path to store the images in specific directory.
