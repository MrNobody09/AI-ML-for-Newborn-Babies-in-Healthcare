# *AI-ML-for-Newborn-Babies-in-Healthcare*
### Shouting out to all of you who are interested in open-source contribution in the field of Healthcare using modern technologies like **Artificial Intelligence(AI), Machine Learning(ML), Deep Learning(DL) and Computer Vision(OpenCV)** and by using the most famous and easy programming language - **Python**, this is the place where you can contribute, learn and get a wonderful experience to showcase your skills in the future !!

### Hey guys👋 myself Samarth, I'm the Program Admin at DevIncept for the 30-day open-source contribution program(DCP2021).

#### I am super excited to share with you all about this project which helps to save lives of many newborn babies which are at a very high-risk, especially the ones that are born before 9 months of pregnancy (also called as Preterm babies).

#### Don't worry. This is just a kind of basic to intermediate level project and you don't have to think much about it as whether it could be a lot tedious or you would not be able to do it in 30 days. You can definitely contribute a lot, learn a lot during these 30-days and even if you are interested in contributing more for this project after the next 30 days, feel free to reach out to me anytime. If you are really interested in Healthcare, then selecting this project for contributing is your best choice.

### Saving a life of a baby just by writing some codes and implementing ML algorithms?! Is it ever possible🤔??

### Yes, it is possible😍.

#### This project is capable of saving a newborn baby's life which is at high-risk of survival.

### But how??

#### You will be accessing the condition of the baby at regular intervals using Pain Scale Assessment technique. To build the pain-scale model, we use **Machine Learning** algorithms to train the raw image/video dataset, and for obtaining frames of images from our model i.e., the baby condition's video dataset, we use **OpenCV** technique. Hence by implementing these techniques, we can help doctors by providing the continous monitoring report on the baby's health condition and help them to save the lives of those babies which are at a very high-risk of survival.

#### More details will be shared with you all once you take up this project for contributing. 

### Tech Stack required:
- Python software installed --> You can install it from here if not installed previously - [https://www.python.org/]()
- Any python supporting IDE(Jupyter Notebook/Pycharm)
- Tensorflow --> `pip install tensorflow`
- OpenCV --> `pip install opencv-python`
- Numpy --> `pip install numpy`

# I wish to see you soon guys.
