The main idea of this project is to develop a Machine Learning algorithm for classifying the facial expressions of Newborn babies in the Hospital as per the Pain Scale Assessment on a scale of **10**. It involves 5 expressions mainly, they are:
1) **Neutral**
2) **Pain due to Hunger**
3) **Pain due to Discomfort**
4) **Pain due to physical body pains/internal organ pains**
5) **Pain due to Attention-seeking**

These 5 pains can be classified under pain scale into **4 different categories**. They are:
1) **No  Pain (Scale 0 )**
2) **Mild Pain(Scale 1-2)**
3) **Moderate Pain (Scale 3 to 6)**
4) **Severe Pain (Scale 7 to 10)**

Based on this classification algorithm, and based on our Data Analysis obtained through the babies Facial expressions, the doctors can get to know the Low-risk and High-risk behaviour from the babies and focus on giving required attention and proper treatment to the babies that are under high-risk severity and can help their life from disasters.
